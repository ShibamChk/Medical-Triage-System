# MedTriage-CXR

MedTriage-CXR is an end-to-end AI-assisted chest X-ray triage system built for multi-class medical image classification, sensitivity-aware decision tuning, explainability, and deployable inference.

The system classifies chest X-ray images into three triage-relevant categories:

- Normal
- No Lung Opacity / Not Normal
- Lung Opacity

These classes are mapped into triage priorities:

- Normal → Low Priority
- No Lung Opacity / Not Normal → Medium Priority
- Lung Opacity → High Priority

## Project Motivation

In medical triage, accuracy alone is not enough. A model can achieve reasonable overall accuracy while still missing high-priority cases.

This project focuses on building a full machine learning pipeline that includes:

- DICOM data processing
- corrupted file validation
- train/validation/test splitting
- modern CNN-based classification
- high-sensitivity threshold tuning
- Grad-CAM explainability
- Streamlit demo app
- FastAPI inference endpoint

The main goal is not only to classify X-rays, but also to demonstrate how an ML system can be designed for practical triage workflows.

## Dataset

This project uses the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset.

The dataset contains chest X-ray DICOM images and metadata labels. For this project, the original labels are converted into a three-class classification task:

| Class | Label | Triage Priority |
|---|---:|---|
| Normal | 0 | Low Priority |
| No Lung Opacity / Not Normal | 1 | Medium Priority |
| Lung Opacity | 2 | High Priority |

The raw dataset is not included in this repository because of size and licensing restrictions.
